# KU-Homework-2

This Project was a bit tough, but practice makes perfect. The only thing that I wasn't sure on how to do, was when viewing on an 'xs' screen, how to get the content
to fit the screen size. I might have just overlooked it and it might have been easy. Whoops!

Additonally, there is one piece of code in my index.html, that would fail verification, but when I fixed it to 'correct' syntax, it would break things and I couldn't figure out why.
